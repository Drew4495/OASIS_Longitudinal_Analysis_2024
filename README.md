Excitation-Inhibition Ratio Analysis showing a sex and APOE-e4 trajectory interaction using the OASIS dataset

For easy following and replication with minimal customizations, please only consult the script titled ""

Two other scripts (one for global EIR and one for DMN-limbic functional network) are provided only for transparency and have not undergone extensive cleaning for easier use.

- All scripts are in scripts directory
- All helper functions and themes are in src ("source") directory

This repository contains an Excitation-Inhibition Ratio (EIR) analysis examining how sex and APOE-e4 status interact over time using the OASIS dataset.

# Overview
Primary Goal: Investigate EIR changes over time based on sex and APOE-e4 trajectories.
Data Source: OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies).


## Usage
To replicate the core analysis with minimal effort:
Focus on the primary script (titled "Manuscript_StatModeling_OASIS_Longitudinal.R").
Make any required path or file name customizations as needed.

Note: Additional scripts are provided for transparency:
Global EIR Analysis
DMN-Limbic Functional Network Analysis

These supplementary scripts have not undergone extensive cleanup or documentation and may be more challenging to follow directly.


## Repository Structure
scripts/

Manuscript_StatModeling_OASIS_Longitudinal.R – Main script for replicating the longitudinal EIR analysis.
MANUSCRIPT_OASIS_Dataset_LMM_Longitudinal.R – Global EIR script (for reference).
MANUSCRIPT_OASIS_Dataset_LMM_Longitudinal_FuncNetworks_DMNAggregated.R – DMN-limbic network script (for reference).

src/
Contains helper functions and shared themes.
