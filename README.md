# Overview: OASIS_Longitudinal_Analysis_2025
Primary Goal: Investigate EIR changes over time based on sex and APOE-e4 trajectories.
Data Source: OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies).


## Usage
To replicate the core analysis with minimal effort:
Focus on the primary script (titled "Manuscript_StatModeling_OASIS_Longitudinal.R").
Make any required path or file name customizations as needed.

Note: Additional scripts are provided for transparency:
Global EIR Analysis
DMN-Limbic Functional Network Analysis

These supplementary scripts have not undergone extensive cleanup or documentation and may be more challenging to follow directly.
